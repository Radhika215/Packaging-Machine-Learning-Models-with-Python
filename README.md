Model packaging is an essential step in the Machine Learning deployment process, where the trained model is prepared in a format that can be easily deployed and integrated into production environments.

Packaging Machine Learning Models with Python
Packaging Machine Learning models involves saving it and wrapping it with an API. Hereâ€™s the process of packaging a Machine Learning model:

1. Step 1: Export/Save the Trained Model
2. Step 2: Writing a Wrapper Function to Load the Model
3. Step 3: Setting Up an API to Serve the Model

So, this is how we can package Machine Learning models in the form of APIs. Model packaging is an essential step in the machine learning deployment process, where the trained model is prepared in a format that can be easily deployed and integrated into production environments.
